# Magic Moments

After any social event, whatsapp chats are filled with students asking each other to share photos. The sharing usually happens by sending a ‘Google drive’ link where they have uploaded the photos. The receiver then has to go through multiple such drive links to find their pictures and download them. To add to this, multiple events have multiple drives which eventually get lost in chats.
Magic Moments removes this hassle entirely by creating a single place where pictures can be uploaded. Each image will have tags and will be sorted using facial recognition. This will enable people who wish to download their personal pictures to filter these images based on their face as well as the tag.
